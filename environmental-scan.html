title: Environmental Scan
---
	<h2 class="pageTitle">Environmental Scan</h2>
		
	
Purpose (heading bold)
The Environmental Scan is an ongoing activity for this initiative. It helps us remain aware of the information, projects, people, tools and resources that reflect explorations and innovations throughout the cultural heritage community as well as in other commercial sectors. We use the environment scan to:
1.	Learn lessons that have been documented elsewhere
2.	Keep an eye on metadata/technology standards initiatives
3.	Identify technologies that we may want to try out or assess
4.	Communicate with other projects that are pursuing useful outcomes
5.	Identify possible guest speakers, trainers, and collaborators


Approach (heading bold)
The format for the display of this information is as an inventory. Only loose categorization is applied which serves to filter the information using basic descriptors. Resources have been gathered from a variety of sources, including but not limited to; professional organizations, websites, journal articles, blogs, twitter feeds, and personal experience.  If you would like more information about each resource listed below you can find it in the spreadsheet linked here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19nNUfM4b5VUVshjE42zWVCCKSfHOO8-YIz3uptaXXYo/edit?usp=sharing  This information will include people involved, summaries, additional links, and focus areas of study.


Call to Action (heading bold)
There is a wide range of expertise in our cultural heritage community and we welcome additions and updates to the scan. To add to projects, sources, readings, professional development opportunities and other related topics email the details to Bree.Midavaine@philamuseum.org with the subject line <<Environmental Scan Addition>>.
Include your name and preferred method of contact if you feel comfortable being contacted for more information regarding your submission.

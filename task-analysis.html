<h2 class="pageTitle">Task Analysis</h2>

<p>
<b>March 2019 - Ongoing</b><br>
Our Task Analysis first addressed and walked through the steps staff members take to conduct their art information-related tasks. We need to understand the trigger or reason as to why they began the task and what is their end goal. We also need to gather the fine details of their workflow, such as what platforms are being used or if they need to contact other staff members to successfully achieve that goal. Other details we look for include the process of their search; whether they are successful in that search; is there a place where they put their newly found information, and what does that workflow entail; and, most importantly, what challenges are encountered which inhibit or complicate the completion of the task. Going through this analysis reveals common and systemic pain points, habits, and tasks. This informs what tools or strategies we develop moving forward and what work we ask our taxonomist and data integration developer to conduct, iterate, and refine. It allows us to prioritize solutions that improve the workflow for our staff and access to our institution-wide content, all in accordance with the goals of the Art Information Commons.
